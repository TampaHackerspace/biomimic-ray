OPENWERX Biomimicry Challenge

This project is building an underwater autonomous robot to map depths and obstacles in brown water (rivers, bays, etc.) environment. 

The robot will be disguised as a marine lifeform and should use natural-appearing motion.

The challenge is to build it using opensource, readily available commercial components, and easily reproducible construction.
